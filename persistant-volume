Activate the Conda Environment: Activate the environment you just created.
conda activate /home/local/data/env/ray

Install Required Packages: Install the necessary Python packages in the activated environment.

pip install ray[all] ipykernel  

Add the Environment to Jupyter: Add the Conda environment to Jupyter so it can be selected from the Jupyter interface.

python -m ipykernel install --user --name demo --display-name "demo"

Accessing the Environment in a New Container: Whenever you access a new container and want to use the created environment, ensure the workspace mounts the PVC and activate the environment using:
